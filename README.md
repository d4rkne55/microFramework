# microFramework

When I worked on a new project based on Symfony, I started to like Symfony.
There were just two problems:

* First, it's big with around 7.000 files
* I couldn't get it running in a subdirectory on my (free, shared) server

The first point isn't that crucial, it just takes a good amount of time
uploading or even deleting (via FTP) the files from the server - but well,
that's a one time job, normally.
IMO the sheer amount of files just didn't fit with my small project.

So I thought about throwing framewoks overboard.
But then it came to my mind that I had time and could create
my *own* basic (micro) framework.

And here I am. :D
